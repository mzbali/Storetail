## Usage

## Configuration

Before running the application locally, you need to set up the environment variables for both the frontend and the backend.

### Frontend

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the frontend directory and add the following:

```env
VITE_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/
```

Replace `VITE_APP_URL` with your actual backend URL.

Run client development server assuming you have Node.js installed and `npm` or `yarn` or `pnpm` installed:

I Reccomend using `pnpm` as it is the manager I used to build this project.

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Backend

Update the `appsettings.Development.json` or `appsettings.json` depending where you running it file in the root of the backend directory with the following:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=5432;Database=storetail;User Id=your_postgres_user_id;Password=your_postgres_password;"
  },
  "StripeSettings": {
    "PublicKey": "your_stripe_public_key",
    "SecretKey": "your_stripe_secret_key",
    "WhSecret": "your_stripe_webhook_secret"
  }
}
```

Run backend development server assuming you have .NET 6 installed:

```bash
cd API
dotnet restore
dotnet watch run
```

Replace `your_postgres_user_id`, `your_postgres_password`, `your_stripe_public_key`, `your_stripe_secret_key`, and `your_stripe_webhook_secret` with your actual values.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
